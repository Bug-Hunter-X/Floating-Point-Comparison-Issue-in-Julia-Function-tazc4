# Julia Floating-Point Comparison Bug

This repository demonstrates a common subtle bug in Julia code involving floating-point comparisons. The `my_function` attempts to handle positive, zero, and negative inputs, but it fails due to inherent limitations in how floating-point numbers are represented.

The `bug.jl` file contains the buggy code, and `bugSolution.jl` provides a corrected version.

## Bug Description

The primary issue lies in the use of `x == 0`.  Due to the way floating-point numbers are stored (in binary format with limited precision), a calculation that mathematically should result in exactly zero might instead produce a value extremely close to zero, but not precisely zero. Thus, the `elseif x == 0` condition might not be met, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The solution uses `isapprox(x, 0)` instead of `x == 0`.  `isapprox` provides a tolerance, allowing for near-zero values to be treated as zero.  This approach is more robust when dealing with floating-point numbers.

## Running the Code

1. Save the code in `bug.jl` and `bugSolution.jl`. 
2. Open Julia REPL or use a Julia IDE.
3. Run the scripts: `include("bug.jl")` and `include("bugSolution.jl")` to observe the difference.
